        <h3>Apiphobia/Spheksophobia</h3>
        <button onclick="slideUp('box');">Read</button>

        <p>
          Every summer, the trees have thorns.<br />
          The grass and flowers and bushes have thorns.<br />
          The brick-wall buildings, the warm concrete,<br />
          That mud puddle by the construction site—<br />
          All these things have thorns.<br />
          A bottle of soda left out to bake<br />
          May have a thorn or two.<br />
          I think I’ve even seen a few<br />
          Protruding from a chicken bone<br />
          Peeking out of a garbage can.<br />
          A thorn here, a thorn there.<br />
          Thousands of them float around in the air!<br />
          On the window, on the wall—<br />
          There’s even thorns inside.<br />
          I’ve got nowhere to hide!<br />
          Every place is a potential prick;<br />
          Even the soft clouds above have thorns.<br />
          Even the invisible stars of day!<br />
          Everything, everyone, everywhere—<br />
          All I see are thorns.<br /><br />

        <h3>Awakening</h3>
        <button onclick="slideUp('box');">Read</button>
        <img src="/images/supernova.jpg" alt="The awakening." />
        <p>
          What is this? It appears<br />
          the sky can't hold itself together;<br />
          the sun's bleeding red and the<br />
          clouds are on fire---<br />
          inferno everywhere.<br /><br />

          Cracks in the sky's blue<br />
          reveal the black of space;<br />
          through this I see the planets<br />
          aligning, as the stars around them<br />
          collapse into a collective nova.<br /><br />

          The moon absorbs the sun's blood<br />
          like a celestial gauze.<br />
          Back home, I look up and<br />
          could swear I see a flock of pigs<br />
          flying over the Ohio---<br /><br />

          and no one sees this but me;<br />
          any who had would surely have thought<br />
          that our world was ending,<br />
          but I know the truth:<br />
          It is but the beginning.<br /><br />

        <h3>Keys</h3>
        <button onclick="slideUp('box');">Read</button>
        <img src="/images/keys.jpg" alt="Lots of keys." />
        <p>
          While window shopping at the mall<br />
          I stop by a jewelry display case<br />
          Where something catches my attention――<br /><br />

          It is a set of silver keys.<br />
          Shiny, beautiful little keys.<br />
          I am obsessed by these keys.<br /><br />

          I don’t know why, but I like keys.<br />
          Lately there’s been something about them…<br />
          Something that gives them importance.<br /><br />

          I guess it’s what they signify.<br />
          Keys, to most, mean access―<br />
          A way in, a way out.<br /><br />

          With keys we open many things――<br />
          Locks, doors, chests and drawers;<br />
          Hearts, souls, our wildest dreams.<br /><br />

          Keys can also set us free――<br />
          From prison cells and rusty cages;<br />
          From the confines of our own madness.<br /><br />

          Maybe I’m seeking access to something―<br />
          Something that’s been denied me for years,<br />
          Or something I myself have denied.<br /><br />

          Or maybe I long to escape,<br />
          To break away and be free…<br />
          Or, perhaps, to set something free.<br /><br />

          Whatever my desire, here I stand,<br />
          Admiring these trinkets and their sparkle,<br />
          Thinking to myself,<br /><br />

          <em>Gotta have one, one of those keys.</em><br />
          But my money isn’t enough. See?—<br />
          I need a way out. I need access.<br /><br />

        <h3>Leviathan</h3>
        <button onclick="slideUp('box');">Read</button>
        <img src="/images/leviathan.jpg" alt="The legendary demon of envy." />
        <p>
          Emerging, I,<br />
          from the depths once more,<br />
          I seek out my prey--<br /><br />

          those whose hearts<br />
          fester with contempt<br />
          for the joy of others,<br /><br />

          who scowl with disdain<br />
          for the merge of souls<br />
          of which they are not one,<br /><br />

          yet also mourn<br />
          for years long past and <br />
          opportunities wasted.<br /><br />

          Their selfish yearning,<br />
          their misplaced determination,<br />
          is what sustains me.<br /><br />

          Such is the case<br />
          with one repeat offender--<br />
          she reappears<br /><br />

          in these volatile waters,<br />
          aboard her dismal vessel<br />
          of past regret, with<br /><br />

          winds of desperation<br />
          blowing into its sails,<br />
          driving it forward<br /><br />

          with no planned destination.<br />
          She sails for opportunity, for<br />
          what she assumes is lost.<br /><br />

          Along the sea's horizon,<br />
          beyond the storms of chaos,<br />
          where daylight has cut through,<br /><br />

          she spots a couple<br />
          coming of age--one stands in light;<br />
          his partner, his shadow.<br /><br />

          They travel the world--<br />
          he illuminates, while she filters,<br />
          lest his own light blind him.<br /><br />

          Such juxtaposition appears<br />
          to bring its witness to despair,<br />
          for she cannot partake.<br /><br />

          For years, she has longed<br />
          for such a love,<br />
          for such a light; yet<br /><br />

          she always reached for it<br />
          with cold, wet hands,<br />
          exploding the bulbs in her face.<br /><br />

          This made her a risk.<br />
          Alone and afraid,<br />
          she keeps a distance,<br /><br />

          watching, waiting, wishing,<br />
          dreaming, coveting,<br />
          hoping against hope----<br /><br />

          I lie in wait, ready to strike,<br />
          ready to feed, as I have<br />
          many a time before,<br /><br />

          when this desperate soul<br />
          has respawned, reemerged,<br />
          to make the same mistake.<br /><br />

          Yet this time around,<br />
          I hesitate, then resign,<br />
          unwilling to attack.<br /><br />

          It seems she is changing--<br />
          still grappling, yet willing<br />
          to abandon her voyage,<br /><br />

          to sail into the sun<br />
          and bask in its warmth,<br />
          out of the darkness,<br /><br />

          out of my reach.<br />
          Her inspiration comes<br />
          from the lovers--<br /><br />

          the light's radiating glow,<br />
          touching all who see it,<br />
          is inviting and warm;<br /><br />

          its contagion spreads<br />
          across a great distance,<br />
          even reaching me.<br /><br />

          His shadow absorbs it, too,<br />
          her own obscure light<br />
          enhanced manyfold----<br /><br />

          and the witness,<br />
          the lonely traveler<br />
          reappearing all these years,<br /><br />

          begins herself to beam,<br />
          standing tall,<br />
          holding her head high,<br /><br />

          ignited by the same light<br />
          which moments before<br />
          nearly deepened her misery.<br /><br />

          But I know that<br />
          this light that radiates<br />
          is not merely spreading,<br /><br />

          but rather activating--<br />
          all who shine it forth<br />
          are themselves the source.<br /><br />

          This light is love--<br />
          the universal kind,<br />
          that which created all.<br /><br />

          It fills the sails<br />
          that carry my sailor,<br />
          pushing toward the sun;<br /><br />

          she casts regrets and envy aside,<br />
          drifting away from despair,<br />
          escaping my grasp.<br /><br />

          Not often am I denied,<br />
          as all humans do err.<br />
          Still, there comes a time<br /><br />

          for everything--even<br />
          to tame this ancient reaper,<br />
          this eater of sin.<br /><br />

          I retreat into the deep,<br />
          deprived, but not bitter--<br />
          I know there are others.<br /><br />

        <button onclick="slideUp('box');">Read</button>
        <img src="/images/leaves.jpg" alt="The colors of fall." />
        <p>
          All around me<br />
          I feel the season turning--<br /><br />

          even as the heat rages on<br />
          and storms parade through the skies,<br /><br />

          as foliage retains its green<br />
          in leaves that dance in the breeze;<br /><br />

          as bees thirst on for sweet nectar,<br />
          and mosquitoes, for tender veins,<br /><br />

          as crickets chirp deep in the grass<br />
          and cicadas chatter across treetops.<br /><br />

          I see al fresco diners sip cocktails<br />
          and restless children play,<br /><br />

          hear the gurgle of fountains<br />
          and the hum of A/Cs,<br /><br />

          feel the heat in the pavement<br />
          warm the soles of my shoes---<br /><br />

          yet I still sense the change,<br />
          the approaching front,<br /><br />

          come to coax all to rest<br />
          in advent of the new.<br /><br />
